There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
Job Search Management Tool

## Sub-Heading ##
Job seekers can use this dashboard to plan and manage the entire job application process.

## Summary ##
The Job Search Management Tool will help you manage the job search process from start to finish. It will help you to manage each application throughout its lifecycle while keeping track of important information (think of dates, contact info, etc). The application will also help you with the research process by bringing up a company profile containing among other things, relevant news referring to that company.

## Problem ##
People often apply to many jobs during the job search process. For each job, it is difficult, tedious, and time-consuming to keep track of different versions of resumes, cover letters, as well as any individual correspondences and follow-ups. Often times people forget to follow-up on an interview, which could improve their chances of being hired.

## Solution ##
Job Search Management Tool provides a central hub that allows the user to easily organize, track and manage the many moving pieces involved in a job search.  It gives the details, current status, next steps and alerts on a per application basis for applications submitted across multiple websites or platforms.
